## Development

### Project Structure
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search/route.ts    # Case law search API
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ draft/route.ts     # Argument generation API

```

### Adding New Legal Sources

To integrate additional legal databases, extend the `searchAdditionalSources()` function in `/app/api/search/route.ts`:

```typescript
async function searchAdditionalSources(query: string, jurisdiction?: string) {
  const additionalCases = [];
  
  // Add new source integration here
  try {
    const newSourceResults = await searchNewSource(query, jurisdiction);
    additionalCases.push(...newSourceResults);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('New source search failed:', error);
  }
  
  return additionalCases;
}
```
